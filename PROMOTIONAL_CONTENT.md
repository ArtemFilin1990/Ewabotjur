### Scenario 4: Product Demo Script

**Input Variables:**
- Promotional Context: Live demo or video presentation
- Target: Decision-makers evaluating legal tech solutions
- Tone: Confident, detailed, benefits-oriented

**Output:**

**Opening Statement (Why This Matters):**  
"Legal departments face a critical challenge: demand for faster turnarounds while maintaining professional quality and managing risk. Manual document preparation, contract analysis, and compliance checks consume valuable time that could be spent on strategic initiatives. Telegram Bot 'Юрист' solves this problem with AI-powered automation that delivers professional legal outputs in minutes, not hours."

**Workflow Demonstration Narrative:**

"Let me show you how this works in practice:

**Scenario 1: Contract Analysis**  
A compliance officer uploads a 20-page contract in PDF format to our Telegram bot. Within 120 seconds, the intelligent router identifies this as a contract review scenario, extracts text including OCR if needed, and generates a comprehensive risk table in XLSX format. The table includes identified risks, severity levels, affected clauses, and recommendations—all ready for executive review.

**Scenario 2: Claim Response**  
A legal professional receives a claim that needs a response by tomorrow. They forward the claim document to the bot with context. In under 2 minutes, they receive a professionally formatted DOCX response draft addressing all claim points, citing relevant legal precedents, and maintaining appropriate legal tone.

**Scenario 3: Company Verification**  
Before signing a major contract, the legal team needs to verify a counterparty. They send the company's INN to our bot, which integrates with DaData to retrieve complete company details and generates an automated risk score based on registration status, address validity, and other key indicators—all in under 20 seconds."

**Key Differentiators vs. Manual Process:**

- **Speed:** 90% faster than manual preparation (minutes vs. hours)
- **Consistency:** Deterministic routing ensures the right workflow every time (75%+ confidence threshold)
- **Quality:** Professional formats (DOCX, XLSX, MD) with proper legal structure and formatting
- **Intelligence:** 9 specialized scenarios covering contract analysis, dispute prep, opinions, explanations, claims, correspondence, risk tables, and case law
- **Security:** Privacy-first design with TTL memory, no long-term data retention, isolated artifact storage

**ROI Statement:**  
"For a legal team processing 50 routine documents per month, this translates to approximately 40 hours saved—freeing your senior lawyers to focus on high-value strategic work. At typical legal billing rates, that's $8,000-$20,000 in monthly capacity reclaimed or client value delivered."

**Closing Invitation:**  
"The bot is available now in Telegram. I invite you to test it with real documents from your workflow. Simply start a chat, type /start, and select your scenario. Experience firsthand how AI can transform your legal operations while maintaining the quality and security standards your organization requires."
